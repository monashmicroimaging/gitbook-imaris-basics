# PART 1: INTRODUCTION TO IMARIS AND LICENSE INFORMATION {#part-1-introduction-to-imaris-and-license-information}

## Imaris 3D/4D Analysis Software {#imaris-3d-4d-analysis-software}

Imaris is a 3D/4D data visualisation and analysis software produced by Bitplane, an Oxford Instruments company. Imaris allows you to 3D capture snapshots and animations for accurate visualisation of your data, as well as creating 3D surface renders and selections for measurements and quantification.

## Use and Licenses {#use-and-licenses}

Imaris requires a license to operate. There are a number of institutional licenses available to run Imaris software on Monash Micro Imaging \(MMI\) computer workstations. These workstations, and the Imaris licenses, can be booked via the iLab booking system and are included as equipment available to all registered MMI users. Bookings on analysis workstations are counted towards your usage hours. To access these workstations, and the software licenses without registering with MMI, please contact MMI staff to discuss hourly rates.

You can access a free 10 day trial of Imaris at [http://www.bitplane.com/imaris/imaris.](http://www.bitplane.com/imaris/imaris) Click on ‘Download Imaris’ and complete the form.

Information and quotes for purchasing your own Imaris license can also be accessed via the Bitplane website.

## Imaris Versions {#imaris-versions}

Imaris x64 8.1.2 is the latest version of Imaris available on the MMI-MHTP workstations. This is the version that should be used if licenses are available. Open Imaris 8.1.2 from the desktop icon and select any special license\(s\) required from the selector by clicking the check box beside the licence and click **OK**. The standard license does not need to be selected, it will start automatically upon opening Imaris.

There are a limited number of licenses available for use which are shared with the facility on Monash campus. Please only select the license you need so other remain free for other people to use.

If Imaris is needed immediately but no licenses are available, Imaris 7.6.5 is available with a special license. Please see MMI-MHTP staff for assistance if you are not aware of how to access this.

This workshop and the accompanying notes will use Imaris 8 – but all notes are applicable to earlier version of Imaris, with the exception of “Arena Mode” which was an inclusion only in later versions of the software.

It will be installed on your laptop before the workshop by MMI-MHTP staff and MUST be removed by staff at the conclusion of the workshop.
