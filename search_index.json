Imaris allows you to 3D capture snapshots and animations for accurate visualisation of your data, as well as creating 3D surface renders and selections for measurements and quantification.\nUse and Licenses \nImaris requires a license to operate. There are a number of institutional licenses available, which run on the Imaris software available on the MMI-MHTP Imaris 2014, Imaris 2011 and Imaris 2008 workstations. These workstations, and the Imaris licenses, can be booked via the ARIN booking system and are included as equipment available to all registered MMI-MHTP users. Bookings on analysis workstations are counted towards your usage hours. To access these workstations, and the software licenses without registering with MMI-MHTP, please contact MMI-MHTP staff to discuss hourly rates.\nYou can access a free 10 day trial of Imaris at http://www.bitplane.com/imaris/imaris. Click on ‘Download Imaris’ and complete the form.\nInformation and quotes for purchasing your own Imaris license can also be accessed via the Bitplane website.\nImaris Versions \nImaris x64 8.1.2 is the latest version of Imaris available on the MMI-MHTP workstations. This is the version that should be used if licenses are available. Open Imaris 8.1.2 from the desktop icon and select any special license(s) required from the selector by clicking the check box beside the licence and click OK. The standard license does not need to be selected, it will start automatically upon opening Imaris.\n\nThere are a limited number of licenses available for use which are shared with the facility on Monash campus. Please only select the license you need so other remain free for other people to use.\nIf Imaris is needed immediately but no licenses are available, Imaris 7.6.5 is available with a special license. Please see MMI-MHTP staff for assistance if you are not aware of how to access this.\nThis workshop and the accompanying notes will use Imaris 8 – but all notes are applicable to earlier version of Imaris, with the exception of “Arena Mode” which was an inclusion only in later versions of the software.\nInformation and Online Tutorials \nYou can find detailed technical information, helpful step-by-step guides, video tutorials and webinars for the Imaris software on the 'Bitplane Learning' website: http://www.bitplane.com/learning.\nUsing Imaris for the Workshop \nIf you are able to, please download and install the free Imaris trial to your laptop for use during the workshop. If you have already used the free trial previously or are unable to download this please inform MMI-MHTP staff so they can organise a training license for you. This is for temporary use only. It will be installed on your laptop before the workshop by MMI-MHTP staff and MUST be removed by staff at the conclusion of the workshop.\nThe Main Imaris Interface \nImaris opens as a full window on your screen. In the main window there are a number of icon panels for different functions. These are outlined below.\n\n"},"part_2_getting_started_in_imaris.html":{"url":"part_2_getting_started_in_imaris.html","title":"PART 2: GETTING STARTED IN IMARIS","keywords":"","body":"PART 2: GETTING STARTED IN IMARIS \nOpening Images \nThe Imaris software can read and open many different image formats, including standard formats such as .tif and .jpg as well as bio-formats from microscope/image capture software. It will automatically read the dimensions (channels, time, z-stacks) and display them appropriately in the software.\nWhen using Imaris in Surpass mode you can open images by ‘dragging and dropping’ them into the Imaris window, or by going to File -> Open and selecting your file from the explorer window.\nTo add files to Imaris in Arena mode see the section on Arena below.\nRearranging Image Dimensions \nOn rare occasions Imaris will read the dimensions of your image in the wrong order and display them incorrectly, for example displaying time points as 3D z-series or different channels as time points.\nYou can easily correct this by going to the Image Processing menu and selecting the dimensions you wish to swap; either Swap Time and Z or Swap Time and Channels.\n\nImaris Modes \nThere are 3 different ways to view your data in Imaris, which we will refer to here as “Operating modes”. These are Arena Mode, Surpass Viewing Mode and Vantage. You can switch between these modes by selecting the corresponding icon from the top left panel of the main Imaris window.\n\nWhen you first open Imaris v8 it will start in Arena Mode. In the Arena you can pre-load all of the images you want to examine, and sort them into different experiments and groups. Arena is not present in earlier version of Imaris.\nIn Surpass Viewing Mode you can visualise the selected images in 2D, 3D or 4D (time series only), navigate around the image and carry out quantification.\nIn Vantage you can generate graphs and plots from your image data. This is rarely used, as most people export quantification data to other statistics programs such as Excel, SPSS or GraphPad Prism. As such the use of Vantage is not covered in the Imaris Basics workshop.\nUsing the Imaris Arena \nTo use Arena, select your workspace or create a new one by clicking the New Assay icon.\n\nGive the “assay” or experiment folder a name and click OK.\n\nThis will generate a new section in the Arena workspace where you can add images and groups.\n\nYou can now add images by dragging and dropping into the Arena workspace or clicking the new Image icon and selecting your file from the explorer window.\n\nYou can group your images together (ie: control vs treatment or by experiment date) by creating a new group within the workspace. Click on the New Group icon, name the group and click OK.\n\n\nDrag and drop your images into the group icon in the workspace to move them.\nTo delete an image, group or assay from Arena select the image or icon and click the Delete button in the panel.\nTo open a specific image from Arena in the Surpass Viewing Mode, double click the image.\nOptions in Surpass Viewing Mode \nIn Surpass Viewing Mode your data will open as a single image in 2D, 3D or 4D, depending on the data type. This is called the 3D View.\n\nYou can choose to work in this 3D View mode or you can select options from the Slice/Easy 3D icon. You can switch between the two easily using the respective icons in the top panel.\nFrom the Slice/Easy 3D Menu you can select several different viewing options from the drop down menu, accessible by clicking on the small down arrow.\n\nSlice will show each z-section of the 3D image as a single panel and allows you to scroll through the section using the slider on the left hand side of the window.\n\nAnother popular option is the Gallery View. This shows all slices from a 3D image in order in a gallery panel.\n\n"},"part_3_viewing_your_data.html":{"url":"part_3_viewing_your_data.html","title":"PART 3: VIEWING YOUR DATA","keywords":"","body":"PART 3: VIEWING YOUR DATA \nNavigating Within Your Images \nIn Surpass Viewing Mode you can navigate around your 3D and 4D images (move and rotate) by clicking and dragging when the cursor is in navigate mode (it will look like two curved arrows when you hover over the image).\nIf the cursor is in section mode (normal single straight arrow when hovering over image) this will not work. You can switch between selection and navigation by hitting Escape on your keyboard, or using the Pointer selection buttons in the top right corner of the Imaris window.\n\nWhen navigating your image, if you stop dragging before you release the mouse button, the image will also stop moving. However, if you release the mouse button while continuing to drag the image it will continue to rotate automatically. Rotation will be on the angle and at the speed that you were dragging the image. To stop this continuous rotation, click on the image.\nYou can easily zoom in on your image using the scroll wheel on your mouse. Scroll up to zoom in and scroll down to zoom out. To visualise where you are in the original image while zoomed in, open the Navigate window by clicking the Navi icon on the bottom left of the Imaris window.\n\nThis will display a smaller version of the original image with a yellow outline demonstrating your current position in the image.\n\nYou can easily return the image to its original orientation and zoom at any time by clicking the Fit and Reset icons from the panel in the bottom left of the Imaris window.\n\nIn Surpass 3D viewing mode images are displayed with a surrounding grid, or frame. You can turn this grid on and off by checking the box next to Frame in the right hand panel (analysis and selection tools) of the Imaris window, under Scene.\n\nViewing Time Data \nWhen viewing 4D (time series) data you can navigate through time points using the slider at the bottom of the Imaris window.\n\nTo play continuously, click the small black arrow, or play button in the panel. To move one frame forward of backwards in the series use the Skip buttons. You can monitor your position through the series in the Time Bar.\n\nAdding and Deleting Channels \nYou can alter the channels in your images by using the Add Channels or Delete Channels tools.\nThis can be useful if your channels were captured as separate images or if you have an empty channel in a multi-channel file.\nTo add a channel to your image go to Edit -> Add Channel… (or use shortcut Ctrl + Shift + A). To remove channels go to Edit -> Delete Channels… (or use shortcut Ctrl + Shift + B).\n\nTo add a new file as a channel in your image, choose the file from the explorer window and click OK. When deleting channels, select the channel(s) you want to delete from the image and click Open.\n\nAdding or Deleting Slices \nYou can also add or delete slices from a z-stack or 3D image.\nThis can be useful if you have over sampled and have blank sections above or below your cells of interest in the z-stack.\nGo to the Edit menu and select the option you require; Add Slices… or Delete Slices.\n\nThis works in the same way as adding and deleting channels.\nSlices can be adding by selecting a file containing the next set of z-slices, then click Open.\nDelete by entering the number of the section(s) you wish to delete from the z-stack in the resulting window and click OK.\n\nOrthoslicer \nOrthoslicer is a tool found in the left hand side selection and analysis tools panel. Click on the Orthoslicer icon, it will appear as a layer in the scene, which you can turn on and off using the checkbox.\n\nYou can use the orthoslicer to navigate through the 3D image in xy, yz or xz. Select the orientation from the options, which will open in the bottom of the selection and analysis tools panel.\nYou can also change the thickness of the slicer and turn the orthoslicer frame on or off in the image.\n\nYou can move the orthoslicer through the image using the slider for Slice Position at the bottom of the panel.\nAs you move through the image you will see only what is above the orthoslicer within the image.\nExamples of a 3D image with and without the orthoslicer are shown below\nOrthoslicer Off:\n\nOrthoslicer On:\n\nSnapshots \nAt any time you can capture a snapshot of the image on your screen using the Snapshot tool. Select Snapshot from the main menu panel.\n\nYou can adjust your original image in the main window to the orientation you need and make any adjustments.\nYou will see a preview of the final image in the Snapshot panel.\n\nCheck the box next to Crop to fill whole snapshot area to zoom the image to fill the entire space.\nWhen you are happy with the image, input the resolution options for your final image into the Image Size section of the Snapshot panel.\nChose Save to File or Copy to Clipboard. If you chose to save to file, input your destination folder by clicking on the … icon. Select your folder from the explorer window and name the image.\nTo capture the snapshot, click Do Snapshot!\nMovies and Animations \nYou can save movies, or animations, of your 3D images with a number of different actions. To start the animation capture select Animation from the main icon menu.\n\nThis will open the animation options and recording bar at the bottom of the Imaris window.\n\nHere you can add animation frames for rotations from the pull up menu options. For other animations such as zooming, or using orthoslicer you will need to perform these during recording.\n\nSet the number of frames you want to record and ensure any options you want included are selected under Playback Options.\n\nWhen you are ready to record your animation, click the Record button (red circle) on the animation bar. Select your location to save the movie file and click OK.\nIf you have added rotation options from the menu it will create this animation automatically. To record other movements, you must perform these yourself now as it records.\nThe recorded movie will be saved in your selected location and open and play automatically once it is complete.\nSaving Options \nYou can save your changes to files in Arena by selecting Store (Shortcut Ctrl + S) from the File menu.\n\nStore As will allow you to store changes to Arena under a new file name.\nUse the Export option (Shortcut Ctrl + E) to save directly to a folder on the hard drive.\nNote that Imaris likes to save in its own format (.ims). Selecting an Imaris file type from the options listed when saving will provide the most accurate version of your image. Imaris files can be opened in FIJI using bio-formats importer, configured for .ims files.\nSelecting .tif will save each slice in your image as an individual file, although time series will give you the option to save all as a single file. Ensure the single file box is selected when saving time series as Tiffs.\nYou can also use the icons on the main panel for Store and Export options.\n\n"},"part_4_image_adjustments.html":{"url":"part_4_image_adjustments.html","title":"PART 4: IMAGE ADJUSTMENTS","keywords":"","body":"PART 4: IMAGE ADJUSTMENTS \nUsing the Display Adjustment Window \nMany of the adjustment you will want to make to your images can be done within the Display Adjustment Window.\nThe Display Adjustment is a free floating window in the Imaris interface that you can move to any location. It usually opens by default when Imaris is launched. If the previous user has closed the window you may need to re-open it by going to Edit -> Show Display Adjustment Window.\n\nClick on a channel (anywhere in the coloured box) to make it the active channel in the window. The active channel with have a yellow boarder.\nYou can turn channels on or off in the image, without deleting them completely, using the check boxes next to the channels in the Display Adjustment window.\n\nBy double clicking on the channel name in the window you can open the Image Properties. You can also access this from Edit -> Image Properties… (or use shortcut Ctrl + I).\nUnder Image Properties you can select the different channels on the left hand panel and assign different LUTs to the channel, or assign a name (ie: from channel 1 to DAPI).\n\nUnder Advanced in the Display Adjustment panel you can find options for adjusting the brightness and contrast and the gamma. These are outlined in more details below.\nAdjusting Brightness and Contrast \nYou can adjust the brightness and contrast on an image using the sliders in the channel boxes.\nYou can also adjust the brightness and contrast for the “active” channel or by adjusting the histogram under Advanced options in the Display Adjustment window.\nYou can use the Reset button at any time to return to the original brightness and contrast settings. Use the Auto button to allow the software to automatically adjust the brightness and contrast.\nGamma Adjustments \nTo change the Gamma on the active channel, use the up and down arrows in the Gamma box in Advanced options under the Display Adjustment window to increase or decrease the gamma value.\n\nYou can also type values directly into the gamma box.\nUse gamma adjustments with caution as this is a non-linear adjustment to your image. Gamma adjustments can skew quantification and any non-linear adjustments to images are not permitted in published journal articles.\nCropping Images \nTo crop images in Imaris go to Edit -> Crop 3D… (or use shortcut Ctrl + W).\n\nThe crop window displays your image in xy, yz and xz. Adjust the yellow bounding boxes in each image, or type values directly into the Crop Dimensions boxes to crop in all 3 dimensions. Select OK to apply the changes.\n\nTo crop a 2D image in Imaris, use the same Crop 3D… tool. Only a single xy image will open in the crop window. Adjust the bounding box and apply changes in the same manner as a 3D image.\nResizing and Resampling \nImages in Imaris can be resized by “resampling” the pixel information within the image. To resample your image go to Edit -> Resample 3D….\n\nIn the Resample 3D window use the up and down arrows to adjust the pixel size for the x, y and z dimensions. You can also type values directly into the boxes.\nThe x and y dimensions will usually come up as fixed ratio by default. To maintain the ratio with the z dimension as well check the box next to Fixed Ratio X/Y/Z.\nWhen one of these boxes is checked, changing the value for one dimension will adjust the corresponding dimension(s) accordingly.\n\nClick OK to apply the changes to your image.\nEditing Time Series \nYou can add multiple time series files together using the Add Time Points… function. To do this go to Edit -> Add Time Points….\n\nThe same as adding channels or z-sections, from the explorer window select the file you want to add on to your time series and click Open.\n\nRepeat this for any additional files you want to combine, ensure you add them in the correct time order.\nYou can also delete time points from a series by going to Edit -> Delete Time Points…. (as above) In the resulting window, enter the time points you want to delete from the series and click OK.\n\nSimilar to this is the Crop Time function. This is also found under the Edit menu.\n\nUnder the Crop Time window enter in the first and last time points you want to keep and click OK. Imaris will discard any time points before and after the numbers you have entered.\n\nThe last way of editing your time series is using Resample Time. This allows you to reduce the total number of time points by removing frames at set intervals. Find this under the Edit menu as well.\n\nIn the Resample Time window enter new number of frames you want to have in your time series. This number should be divisible by the total number of frames to ensure even resampling. Click OK to apply the change to your time series.\n\n"},"part_5_getting_started_with_selection_and_analysis.html":{"url":"part_5_getting_started_with_selection_and_analysis.html","title":"PART 5: GETTING STARTED WITH SELECTION AND ANALYSIS TOOLS","keywords":"","body":"PART 5: GETTING STARTED WITH SELECTION AND ANALYSIS TOOLS \nBasic Distance Measurements \nA lot of the quantitation in Imaris requires you to select certain features in the image using the selection tools. However you can quickly and easily perform a 2D measurement for a distance between two points in your image, or a circumference, without the need for selection.\nSwitch your image into Slice view and scroll to the plane you want to measure. From the right hand side panel, select line (for distance) or polygon (for circumference) under tool type.\n\nClick on the image at your starting point, then your secondary point for a line, or all points around the object to create a polygon. You can move points by clicking inside the box and dragging.\n\n\nThe distance of the line or polygon you have drawn will be displayed in the right hand side panel.\nYou can immediately draw another line on the image by clicking another location as your start point. Polygons will add to the existing line and therefore old lines must be deleted before drawing a new polygon. Delete a line or polygon with the Delete button on the panel.\n\nThis can be a quite laborious process so it is only recommended for a small number of measurements.\nSpots Selection \nTo select objects in your images for counting and analysis you can use the Spots selection tool.\nTo begin selection click the Spots icon in the Selection and Analysis Tools panel.\n\nThis will add a layer to your Scene called “Spots 1” and open the Spots Creation Wizard at the bottom of the panel. The layer can be turned on and off in the scene by checking or unchecking the box beside it here.\nIn the first step of the Spots Creation Wizard, leave the creation parameters as default.\nFor particularly large images you can check the box to Segment only a Region of Interest in order to keep processing times down. Select the option to Process entire image finally to apply the selection to the whole image after selection.\nClick on the blue arrow to proceed to the next step.\nUse the green arrow to skip to the end and use automatic creation with the default parameters unchanged.\nUse the orange cross to cancel the selection wizard at any point during creation.\n\nIn the next step of the Spots Creation Wizard, Select the channel you want to segment from the drop down list under Source Channel. It can often be helpful to turn off other channels in the image to see your channel of interest more clearly.\nChange the Estimated XY Diameter to fit the objects you are selecting. You can usually get an idea of the size by comparing to the scale bar in the image.\nFor most Spot Selection you will leave PSF-elongation modelling unchecked, but select Background Subtraction.\nClick on the blue arrow to proceed to the next step, or the green arrow to complete the selection without changing any other parameters.\n\nIn the third step of the Spots Creation Wizard use filters to remove any non-specific selections.\nChoose the filter from the drop down menu and adjust the level with the Histogram.\nYou can move and rotate the image to check the selection throughout the entire 3D environment before applying the filter and completing selection.\nTo use more than one filter, adjust your first, then click + Add\nand choose and adjust your second filter.\nClick the green arrow to complete the selection.\nThe spots selection is now complete and all selected objects will be ‘marked’ by a sphere overlayed in the image.\n\nThe Spots Selection Wizard in the bottom left hand corner will now be replaced with a series of tabs which allow you to further edit the spots.\n\nIn the “Edit” tab you can select Spots within the image by switching the cursor to the selector and clicking on the spot. You can then recenter, duplicate or delete the spot.\nSelecting the “Wand” tab will allow you to go back and rebuild the creation algorithm from the start if you are unhappy with the final results and cannot correct it using editing.\n\nThe \"Graph\" tab contains measurements for the selected spots. \nFrom the drop down menu you can choose specific values or averages. Under specific values, you can futher select a measurement of interest.\nSpecific values will show you the value for each individual spot in the image, averages will show you all values averaged over the entire selection, as well as count.\nYou can extract these measurement values to an Excel spreadsheet. Use the Single Save button at the bottom to save only the currently displayed values. Or use the Multiple Save button to save all values. In the resulting explorer window select the location and name the file. The Excel sheet will open after saving.\nBasic Tracking \nSpots Creation can also be used on time series to track objects through time.\nBegin the process as you did above, by selecting Spots from the Selection and Analysis Tools panel.\n\nThis time, the Spots Creation Wizard has recognised you are working on a time series. You may notice there are now 6 steps in the wizard instead of 3.\nIn the first step, Track Spots (over Time) will now show. Ensure this box is checked and set all other parameters as before.\nAs before, use the blue arrow to proceed to the next step, the green arrow to skip to the end and use automatic creation with the default parameters unchanged or the orange cross to cancel the selection wizard at any point during creation.\nSteps 2 and 3 are used for initial detection of the spots and are identical to the previous spots selection, using channel, diameter and filters to select the objects in your image.\nAs with single images you can scroll through your time series and rotate and move in 3D at any point during selection to check your accuracy in space and time.\nOnce your objects have been selected, you can apply filters to the tracking over time.\n\nIn step 4 you can manually select spots (switch cursor to selection mode and click on the specific spot) to delete, duplicate or recenter, as previously in the post-selection editing.\nThis allows you to remove any detected object that you don’t want tracked (ie: cells that leave the field of view during tracking, etc).\n\nIn step 5 of the wizard, you can select the type of Tracking Algorithm to apply to the time series from the drop down menu. For most tracking Autoregressive Motion will work well to track movement.\nYou can also adjust the Tracking Parameters, including the Maximum Distance to track an object and the Maximum Gap Size (ie: how many frames to between an object disappearing and reappearing to allow linking the tracks together).\nProceed to the next step with the blue arrow or complete the selection without changing any other parameters with the green arrow.\n\nIn step 6 of the Spots Tracking Wizard, you can apply filters similar to step 3 of Spots Selection.\nHere you can filter on properties such as Track Duration.\nSelect a filter from the drop down menu and use the Histogram to adjust. Add a new filter using the + Add button.\nComplete the Spots Selection and Tracking using the green arrow.\nFollowing selection and filtering, all detected objects will be overlayed in the image with Spots and a path of the track will be displayed, colour coded for time.\n\nAs with the basic Spots Selection tool, the panel in the bottom left hand corner will now be replaced with a series of tabs which allow you to further edit the spots and tracks. Spot Colour and Filters tabs are similar to Spot Selection.\n\nThe “Edit” tab now has the option to select Spots or Tracks for editing.\nYou can select a specific spot or track in the image or select a track in the editing tab.\nTracks can’t be deleted here, but you can select two shorter tracks that you have recognised as being from the same object and connect them, by selecting both and clicking Connect.\nYou can also spit a track that the wizard has detected as a single object, if it was in fact from 2 separate objects. Select the track and click Disconnect. Enter the point at which you want the track separated.\nUnder the “Graph” tab you will now find measurements for the tracks over time.\nAs with Spots, you can select Specific Values or Averages. Under Specific Values you can select measurements such as track length track duration.\n\nYou can save these measurements to Excel files as before.\nCreating Surfaces \nTo select connected objects, surfaces or volumes in your images use the Surfaces selection tool.\nTo begin, choose Surfaces from the Selection and Analysis Tools panel.\n\nAs for spots, this will add a layer to your Scene called\n“Surfaces 1” and open the Surfaces Creation Wizard at the bottom of the panel.\nStep 1 of the Surfaces Creation Wizard is similar to Spots. Leave the creation parameters as default and check the box to Segment only a Region of Interest and Process entire image finally for large images\nClick on the blue arrow to proceed to the next step or the green arrow to skip to the end and use automatic creation with the default parameters unchanged. Use the orange cross to cancel the selection wizard at any point during creation.\n\nIn step 2, Select your channel from the drop down menu and choose either Absolute Instensity or Subtract Background under Thresholding.\nClick the blue arrow to proceed to the next step.\n\nIn step 3, use the Histogram to adjust the detection threshold until you have the optimal fit for your data.\nThe surface overlay should cover as much of your signal as possible with minimal excess noise detection.\nProceed tot eh next step with the blue arrow or complete the selection with the green arrow.\n\nFinally, use filters to remove any non-specific selections.\nSelect the filter from the drop down menu and adjust the parameters in the Histogram.\nAdd new filters using the + Add button.\nComplete the selection process by clicking on the green arrow.\nYou should now see a surface render overlaying the signal in your image.\n\nYou can again change the colour of your Surfaces or apply new filters using the tabs in the bottom left hand panel.\nUnder the “Edit” tab you now have options to cut surfaces, along with duplicating and deleting, as for spots.\nTo edit a surface, switch the cursor to selection mode and click on the surface you want to edit, followed by clicking your desired function in the tab.\n\nTo use the “scissors” to cut a surface, first navigate the image to the orientation that best shows the join you want to cut. Switch the cursor to section and hold shift then click on the join. A line will appear across the surface. If you are unhappy with the orientation or position, click on Clear Scissor and adjust the image orientation and try again.\nWhen you are happy with the line position, click on Cut Surface to separate the two parts of the surface object.\n\nYou can find measurements for the selected surfaces under the “Graph” tab. As with Spots, you can select Specific Values or Averages. Under Specific Values you can select measurements such as area, intensity and volume of the surfaces.\n\n\nAgain you can save these measurements to Excel files using the same methods as Spots and Tracking.\nSaving and Reusing Selection Criteria \nOften we need to use the same selection criteria throughout our analysis to maintain consistency and prevent bias in our results. This can easily be done by saving and reusing our initial selection algorithms.\nTo save your selection algorithm generate your selection with optimal parameters. After finishing selection go to the “Wand” or rebuilding tab and click on Store Parameters for Batch.\n\nIn the popup window, give your parameters a name and select the storage location in either your Arena workspace or under the general use Favourite Creation Parameters. Click OK to save.\n\nTo reuse saved parameters, select the tools button under Favourite Creation Parameters in step 1 of any creation wizard.\nSelect the stored parameters that you want to use and click OK.\n\n\nIf you stored your parameters under Favourite Creation Parameters when saving, they may also be found in the Favourite Creation Parameters drop down menu.\n"},"acknowledgements.html":{"url":"acknowledgements.html","title":"Acknowledgements","keywords":"","body":"Acknowledgements \nThese workshop notes were prepared by Dr Sarah Creed of Monash Micro-Imaging at the Monash Health Translation Precinct.
